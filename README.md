# Web-Design-Challenge-

The task for this challenge was to create a 7 page website based on a previous project using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.

The previous project I based it off was the API-Challenge where we had to compare the latitude of countries to temperature, humidity, wind speed and cloudiness. It was also necessary to convert the csv file of data to HTML so it could be displayed on the website.

A main feature of the website is that it has to be responsive to changes in size of the web browser.
